HOW TO CREATE THE SPARKY V2.0 PROJECT

This file will tell you how to get from the text in the Robot.cpp main file and the Robot.h header file in 
the same directory as this file to a full robot project. This process is outlined in the steps below.

1. Open FRC Visual Studio (VS) code. If you do not have this downloaded, please do so in the links in the 
   README.md file found in the 6960-Rusty-Huskies/first-launch-2019/README.md file.
     
2. Press Control + Shift + P and select 'WPILib: Create a new project'.

3. Select 'Template,' 'cpp,' 'Timed Robot'. Configure the rest of the project however you'd like, and fill 
   the 'Enter a team number' field with 6960.
   
4. The project will automatically start a build task. Wait for this task to complete.

5. Copy the text found in 6960-Rusty-Huskies/first-launch-2019/Programming/Sparky V2.0/Robot.cpp into the 
   Robot.cpp file found in the automatically generated project. This file is by default in src/main/cpp/Robot.cpp.
   
6. Repeat step 5 for the Header file, the text for which is stored in Sparky V2.0/Robot.h, and by default is in the 
   project directory at src/main/include/Robot.h.
   
7. Build the project by pressing Control + Shift + P and selecting 'WPILIB: Build Robot Code.

8. If the build fails, read through the above steps again and double check that you executed every step correctly.
